Border Patrol agents apprehended 32-year-old James Paul Markowitz in his vehicle in Brackettville, Texas, "after he was identified as a suspect in an alien smuggling case," a CBP [statement](/files/2020-02-05_cbp.pdf) read ([original link](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/speeches-and-statements/cbp-statement-regarding-death-us-citizen)). While it is unclear whether he was involved in the incident, Markowitz did have small amounts of methamphetamine and cocaine in his car, which he swallowed in an attempt to avoid detection.

During processing at the Brackettville Border Patrol station, Markowitz "began exhibiting signs of distress." CBP's notification to Congress stated that an ambulance was called at 6:00 PM. A CBS News records review [revealed](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/james-markowitz-border-patrol-arrest-government-silence/) that "the ambulance wasn't actually called for until 6:26 PM." Markowitz died of a drug overdose.

Markowitz's stepfather has been unable to get more information from CBP about the circumstances of his death.

In a March 3, 2020 [letter](/files/2020-03-03_chc.pdf) to DHS, Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairman Rep. Joaquín Castro (D-Texas) and CHC Immigration Task Force Chairwoman Rep. Linda Sánchez (D-California) accused DHS of having "failed to provide further clarity or transparency surrounding the death of a U.S. citizen in CBP custody."
