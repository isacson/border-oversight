An ACLU [complaint](/files/200218_aclu.pdf) to the DHS Inspector-General cited the recent case of "Baby Sofía," a six-week-old infant whose Honduran parents were apprehended in Border Patrol's San Diego sector ([original link](https://cbpabusestest2.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/2020-02-18-dhs-oig-cmplt-2-final.pdf)).

> The agent who transported the family to a nearby Border Patrol station subjected them to a reckless "rough ride," causing Sofia to be jostled severely in her carrier as the Border Patrol vehicle traversed uneven terrain.\[37\] At the station, the agent who fingerprinted the family yelled at Gloria \[the mother\] and told her she was a terrible mother for bringing her baby to the United States.\[38\]

While the family was in custody, Sofía became ill. Agents brought the mother and daughter to a nearby emergency room, leaving the father in custody.

"At the emergency room, a doctor determined that Sofia was dehydrated and constipated. The doctor explained that there was little he could do for the baby, and insisted that the baby see a pediatrician as soon as possible. Instead—and in direct contravention of this medical advice—the Border Patrol returned Gloria and Sofia to detention."

Through a second day in custody, the baby's condition worsened. Mother and daughter were taken to a nearby children's hospital.

> "The examining physician again concluded that the infant was dehydrated and constipated, and administered a rectal suppository to help move the baby’s bowels. The doctor also scolded the Border Patrol agents who had accompanied Gloria and Sofia to the hospital, admonishing them that the conditions inside the facility (as Gloria had described them) '\[were\] no conditions for a newborn.'" Agents failed to follow doctors' recommendation that the baby be given prune or fruit juice to soften her bowels.

Following two more days in custody and another visit to the emergency room, Border Patrol released the family to the San Diego migrant respite center. Sofía's mother said that, since a final check-up in Tijuana, the baby's weight had dropped in custody from 11.46 points to 8.82 pounds.
