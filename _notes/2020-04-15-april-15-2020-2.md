A [complaint](https://cbpabusestest2.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/2020-04-15-dhs-oig-cmplt-3-final.pdf) from the ACLU Foundation of San Diego and Imperial Counties and ACLU Border Rights Center reported on CBP's failure to implement a detainee locator system, which complicates efforts to reunify separated families:

> A detainee locator system allows family members, lawyers, and other advocates to pinpoint exactly where a particular person is being held.\[31\] Typically, the use of such a system requires knowledge of the detainee’s country of origin and “alien number” (“A number”), or their exact full name, country of origin and date of birth. Unlike ICE, CBP has never implemented a detainee locator system, nor does it facilitate visitation or communications with family or lawyers. CBP’s refusal to do these things aggravates the harms that stem from the agency’s practice of separating family members through processing and detention. Although ICE’s system is far from perfect, advocates and families rely on it to locate their clients and loved ones.
