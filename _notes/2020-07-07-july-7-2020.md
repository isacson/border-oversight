A [complaint](https://cbpabusestest2.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/2020-07-07-dhs-oig-cmplt-4-final.pdf) to the DHS Inspector-General, submitted by the ACLU Foundation of San Diego and Imperial Counties and ACLU Border Rights Center, denounced "CBP officials’ egregious verbal abuse of detained individuals," including "many instances in which Border Patrol agents verbally abused individuals, including children, in their custody," including asylum seekers.

> Agents berated migrants for traveling to the United States and attempting to exercise their legal right to seek asylum.\[16\] “Xenophobic nationalism is widespread,” and derogatory comments are often accompanied by threatened or actual physical violence.\[17\] Agents bully LGBTQ people, equate migrants to animals, and ridicule and humiliate parents trying to protect their children.\[18\]

The complaint cited numerous explicit examples, some of them reproduced below. All are from interviews with migrants completed between March and July of 2019 with people recently released from Border Patrol custody in San Diego and Tijuana.

> This abuse may involve bullying, harassment, threats of violence or other harm, denigration, ridicule, racism, and misstatements about U.S. immigration law, including an individual’s right to seek asylum. Recently detained individuals related the following statements to our investigator: \[28\]

> \[28\]: Most of ACLU’s interviews were conducted in Spanish, with contemporaneous notes taken in Spanish by our investigator. Where our notes contain the original Spanish quotes, we have provided that original (as relayed by the interviewee to our investigator) as well as our English translation. At times, our investigator memorialized a statement in English only during her interview (via simultaneous translation). In such cases, we have reproduced her English translation here.  
> Many of these quotes use degrading and offensive language that we hesitated to reprint. In the end, we decided to reproduce the language reported to remain as faithful as possible to the accounts of those we interviewed.
