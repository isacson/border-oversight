A CBP officer and a contract security guard shot and killed a man, who was apparently wielding a knife, just inside the U.S. border at the Calexico, California port of entry. The Palm Springs _Desert Sun_ [reported](https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/crime_courts/2020/07/09/gunfire-reported-near-calexico-united-states-mexico-border/5407043002/):

> Pete Flores, director of field operations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in San Diego, said an individual brandishing a knife approached the agent and the security guard just after 9 a.m. at the international border's pedestrian crossing.
> 
> "As the man approached the CBP officer and the guard with the knife, both drew and fired their weapons, and the man was shot," Flores said in a written statement.
> 
> …Mexican law enforcement officials in Mexicali were dispatched to the pedestrian crossing after receiving reports of an incident there, they said in a statement in Spanish.
> 
> Officers observed a man walking toward the gate, carrying a bag over his shoulder. The man was "supposedly" carrying narcotics, the statement said. It said he fled toward the U.S. side of the gate when he saw Mexican police officers.
> 
> The man dropped the bag before crossing the international line and, according to the statement, U.S. customs agents shot him after he crossed into the U.S.

CBP's Flores said that the DHS Inspector-General, the FBI, and CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility were investigating the incident.
