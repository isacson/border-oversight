CBP [reported](/files/2020-07-26_cbp.pdf) that Border Patrol agents "observed a suspicious vehicle" near Brackettville, Texas and attempted a vehicle stop ([original link](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/speeches-and-statements/cbp-statement-accident-fatalities)). "The driver then attempted to elude agents by fleeing at a high rate of speed," after which "agents ultimately lost sight of the vehicle," locating it shortly afterward, rolled over. "The motor vehicle accident resulted in fatalities and serious injuries. The driver of the vehicle fled the scene, but was later apprehended."

Two people aboard the vehicle died. The Kinney County, Texas Sheriff's Office [posted](/files/2020-07-26_kinney.pdf) to Facebook that they "are believed to be illegal alien" ([original link](https://www.facebook.com/KinneyCountySheriffsOffice/posts/738457053578706)).

Texas's Department of Public Security was investigating, and CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility had the incident "under review."
