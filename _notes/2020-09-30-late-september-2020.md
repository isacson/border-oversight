The Kino Border Initiative reported:

> In the past two weeks, KBI documented 5 separate incidents of migrants CBP expelled to downtown Nogales, Sonora between 11PM and 1:30AM. In at least 3 of these incidents, those who were expelled were forced to sleep outside because no hospitality resources were available at that hour. In 4 of those cases, migrants did not receive any documentation to enter Mexico since Mexicoâ€™s National Migration Institute (INM) was not open. In one case, a man who INM received requested officials allow him to stay at the office for the night and INM officials refused. He then slept on a bench in downtown Nogales, where he was robbed.
