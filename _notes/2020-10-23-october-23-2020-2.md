The _New York Times_, citing Customs and Border Protection, [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/us/border-patrol-shooting-texas.html) that “Border Patrol agents shot and killed the driver of a car that had been carrying unauthorized immigrants in Laredo, Texas, on Friday, after the car reversed into an agent and pinned him against another vehicle.” Border Patrol [acknowledged](/files/2020-10-23_laredo.pdf) that an “agent-involved shooting” took place at approximately 10:00 PM ([original link](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/speeches-and-statements/initial-statement-agent-involved-shooting-laredo)).

The agents were reportedly responding to a possible human smuggling incident, along with officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations (ICE HSI) and the Webb County, Texas Constable’s Office.

The _Times_ reported:

> Border Patrol agents and officials from Homeland Security Investigations, which is part of ICE, identified themselves as they approached the car, officials said.
> 
> But the driver “suddenly accelerated in reverse,” pinning a Border Patrol agent and a person whom he had been interviewing against another vehicle, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement.
> 
> The driver did not respond to orders to stop and “agents deployed lethal force to stop the threat,” the statement said.
> 
> The driver, who was not identified by name, died at the scene. The Border Patrol agent, who sustained leg injuries, was taken to a hospital and later released.

Two other people in the car were injured. In a [video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=262600961857758&ref=sharing) posted to Facebook, Border Patrol Laredo Sector Chief Matthew Hudak said that “agents from both agencies deployed lethal force so stop that threat.” The Laredo Police Department and FBI, he added, were leading the investigation into the incident. “Agents did what they needed to do to protect their fellow agent and to protect the suspect that was being interviewed,” Hudak concluded.
