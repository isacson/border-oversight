Border Patrol agent Ryan Gonsalves [shot and killed](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/us-border-patrol-involved-in-shooting-in-san-ysidro/2430349/) David Angel Villalobos-Baldovinos, a Mexican citizen and Tijuana resident who allegedly tried to enter the United States illegally. Gonsalves confronted Villalobos-Baldovinos near the Las Américas outlet mall next to the San Ysidro port of entry. “An alleged scuffle unfolded, and the agent shot Villalobos-Baldovinos once in his upper body,” the _San Diego Union-Tribune_ [reported](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2020-10-27/police-release-name-of-man-fatally-shot-by-border-patrol-agent). “The agent suffered minor injuries, though police did not elaborate on the extent of the injuries.”

San Diego police were investigating the shooting. “We’re still putting the pieces together on this,” police Lt. Andra Brown told the _Union-Tribune_ on October 27.

Villalobos-Baldovinos reportedly had family on both sides of the border. He was briefly [jailed](/files/2019-07-30_villalobos.pdf) in San Diego in 2019 for the misdemeanor charge of improper entry ([original link](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-casd-3_19-cr-02881/pdf/USCOURTS-casd-3_19-cr-02881-0.pdf)).

This would be the first of two Border Patrol-involved fatal shootings in the agency's San Diego sector within the space of six months. Agents would [shoot and kill](/event/may-14-2021/) Silvestre Vargas Estrada on May 14, 2021.
