Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) expelled to Guatemala 32 unaccompanied children who had been encountered at the border. The expulsion came hours after U.S. Federal District Judge Emmet Sullivan had ordered a halt to the Trump administration's practice of expelling unaccompanied children under the Title 42 pandemic order.

On January 19, 2021—the Trump administration's final day—DHS officials recognized before the court that the expulsion violated Judge Sullivan's order, "adding that they will begin the process of getting the group back to apply for asylum," _BuzzFeed_ [reported](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/us-officials-violated-court-order-immigrant-children).
