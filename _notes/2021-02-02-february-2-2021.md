The Kino Border Initiative reported:

> Border Patrol expelled a group of 43 Central American and Mexican migrants to downtown Nogales last Tuesday \[Feb. 2nd\] at 11PM. One Honduran man in the group shared that BP agents did not give them any directives about where they could go to find shelter, nor were any Mexican officials there to receive them upon arrival. The group dispersed, and he continued walking with 2 other migrants. They asked a man on the street where they could find a shelter, and began walking west. As they approached a cemetery, 5 men came toward them, one with a gun. They men forced them into the cemetery at gunpoint, and told them to take out all their belongings. The Honduran man pleaded to keep his phone so he could communicate with his family. In response, one of the assailants began beating him in the ribs and said he would beat him again if he said another word. The men detained them in the cemetery for an hour before finally letting them go.
