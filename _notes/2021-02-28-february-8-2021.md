The Kino Border Initiative reported:

> Last week, a young Guatemalan woman who crossed the border through the desert was approached by Border Patrol agents traveling on four wheelers. When she tried to run, one agent hit her with his four wheeler. The impact threw her into a cluster of thorny bushes. When she arrived at KBI, she was in a great deal of pain. Her legs were throbbing, and she had thorns embedded in the skin on her legs and back.
