The Kino Border Initiative reported that upon releasing them into Yuma, Arizona, CBP has been dropping asylum-seeking migrants in areas far from shelter and services.

> On several occasions, rather than transport migrants to other locations where they can access services, CBP has simply dropped off migrants in parking lots in Yuma. Since many of these migrants have traveled distances in the desert, they are often being abandoned with injuries, including a young man who Border Patrol left alone at a bus station with a recently amputated foot.
