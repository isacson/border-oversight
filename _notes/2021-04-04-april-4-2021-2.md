Three Black CBP officers stationed near the Canadian border in Michigan filed a lawsuit alleging that the agency “routinely targets and harasses” Black travelers. As [reported](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/04/04/cbp-officers-lawsuit-racial-profiling-issue-us-canada-border/7076949002/) by the _Detroit Free Press_, the suit pointed out that “nationwide, Black people account for less than 6% of the total CBP workforce of 21,185. More than 62% of employees are white; another 25% are Hispanic.” (The U.S. Census [estimated](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045221) that 13.8 percent of the U.S. population was "Black or African American alone" in 2021.)
