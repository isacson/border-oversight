The Kino Border Initiative reported:

> A Guatemalan father who had been expelled from the US four months ago was selling food in the street with his family one day when an armed man arrived and killed him in front of his wife and seven-year-old daughter. His wife and daughter fled their hometown to seek protection in the US and crossed between ports of entry to assert their asylum claim. The woman carried her husbandâ€™s death certificate and showed it to Border Patrol agents, who accused them of purchasing the document at a pharmacy and refused to hear their fear claim.
