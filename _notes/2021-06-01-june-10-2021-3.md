The Kino Border Initiative reported:

> A man arriving at our center reported watching from a distance as Border Patrol agents emptied the water bottles belonging to the apprehended members of his group. Dehydrated, he continued walking in the desert alone until he encountered another group of Border Patrol agents who physically assaulted him and mocked his dehydrated state, refusing to give him water until they arrived at a Border Patrol station.
