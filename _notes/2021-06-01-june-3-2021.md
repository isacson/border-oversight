The Kino Border Initiative reported:

> One woman who traveled with her son and nephews said that the Border Patrol agent who found them yelled at them aggressively, refused to let them speak at all, and threatened to hand them over to the police when they tried to speak after she told them to “shut up.” They were also denied food while in custody.
