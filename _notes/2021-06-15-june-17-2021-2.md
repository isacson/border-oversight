The Kino Border Initiative reported:

> Last week, a Honduran father of 5 whose wife is 3 months pregnant was detained by ICE as he and his family were processed through the consortium process at the downtown Nogales port of entry. The father does not have any criminal history in the US, and Spanish is the family’s second language, as they are part of the Garífuna indigenous community in Honduras.
> 
> As the mother shared in her testimony at [the interfaith #SaveAsylum event this week](https://www.kinoborderinitiative.org/press-release-migrants-faith-and-community-leaders-in-tucson-arizona-host-interfaith-event-to-express-welcome-and-blessing-to-migrants-demand-the-restoration-of-asylum-access/), when the father was separated from his family, the CBP officer assured his wife that he would only be detained a day or two, but he has now been separated from his family for over a week.
> 
> His wife, who is stranded waiting for her husband’s release at a shelter in Tucson with their 5 children, attempted to set an appointment to visit her husband at La Palma, but was unable to do so because the visitation phone system is all in English. She has not received any clarity about when her husband will be released, and a week after his detention had not been able to make any contact since she does not have money to put in his commissary.
