The Kino Border Initiative reported:

> A family who attempted crossing in two different Border Patrol sectors reported insultingly dismissive treatment in every interaction they had with Border Patrol agents. Border Patrol agents repeatedly told them, “I don’t care about your problems,” laughed at them and ridiculed them. In one interaction, the agent reportedly said, “What a coincidence. All of you seem to be coming because someone wants to kill you. That’s not my problem.”
