The Kino Border Initiative reported:

> Recently, one of our legal service partners spoke with Maily Martinez, who attempted to cross the border with her husband and son near the Yuma port of entry in early July. Maily was eight months pregnant with twins at the time. When BP agents encountered the family, the woman expressed that she urgently needed medical attention, but the agents ignored her and expelled her back to Mexico. She realized shortly after that the twins had died, likely right around the time that Border Patrol denied her medical aid.

A _Noticias Telemundo_ [story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXZ9e1jQTew) about the Honduran woman's case, citing the hospital in San Luis Rio Colorado, Sonora, noted that the fetuses perished from "interruption of feto-placental circulation." The news outlet asked Border Patrol about the case; the agency responded, "We do not comment on individual cases due to privacy issues."
