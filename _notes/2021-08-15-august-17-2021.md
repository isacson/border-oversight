The Kino Border Initiative reported:

> A Guatemalan man who was migrating due to extreme poverty attempted crossing into the U.S. near McAllen, Texas. Border Patrol apprehended him, held him under a highway bridge for several days \[Border Patrol's [“Temporary Outdoor Processing Site” (TOPS)](/event/june-15-2021/) facility in Mission, Texas\], then told him they would arrange transport to his family members in the United States.
> 
> They flew him to Tucson, and when they took him off the flight, told him they would take him to a place where he could sign papers for the transport to his family. Instead, they put him on a bus to Nogales, where he was expelled. He did not know he was being expelled until he reached the port of entry.
