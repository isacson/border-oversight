"In August 2021," a Human Rights First [report](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/illegal-and-inhumane-biden-administration-continues-embrace-trump-title-42-policy-attacks) documented, "DHS expelled Cynthia, a 21-year-old pregnant Honduran woman to Mexico, without providing her water or medical attention after she had begged for something to drink and to see a doctor for stomach pain." The case is [mentioned](https://www.texasobserver.org/migrants-say-border-patrol-agents-ignored-pleas-for-medical-help/) briefly in the _Texas Observer_, which identified Border Patrol as the expelling agency. At a Catholic migrant shelter in Reynosa, Mexico, "doctors administered antibiotics for Cynthia’s infection."
