_Politico_ [revealed](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/23/cbp-americans-caravans-border-513829) the existence of a DHS Inspector-General [report](/files/2021-09-20_oig.pdf), which would not be publicly released until October ([original link](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2021-09/OIG-21-62-Sep21.pdf)). The report finds that CBP improperly targeted U.S. advocates and journalists whom the agency believed had some involvement with 2018-19 migrant caravans through Mexico. These individuals were subjected to more intrusive inspections when crossing the border into the United States, and “sensitive information” about them was shared with the Mexican government.

An October 11, 2021 [article](https://www.propublica.org/article/a-secretive-counterterrorism-team-interrogated-dozens-of-citizens-at-the-border-government-report-finds) about the report at _ProPublica_ focused on the Tactical Terrorism Response Team, a secretive CBP intelligence unit that is "trained in counterterrorism, not immigration issues.” It found, “\[A\]t least 51 U.S. citizens were flagged for interrogation-often based on evidence as flimsy as once having ridden in a car across the border with someone suspected of aiding the caravan."

On January 8, 2022, the DHS Inspector-General published a heavily redacted [report](/files/2022-01-08_oig.pdf) focusing on CBP’s revocations of “trusted traveler” status for those singled out as under suspicion ([original link](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2022-01/OIG-22-13-Jan22-Redacted.pdf)). Officers, the report concluded, "did not evaluate unsubstantiated information, and made unsupported conclusions" when they revoked the "trusted" status of two U.S. citizens whom they believed were aiding the 2018-19 migrant caravans.

On January 11, 2022, NBC's San Diego affiliate [spoke](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/investigations/cbp-officer-who-asked-mexico-to-deny-entry-to-some-us-citizens-speaks-under-oath/2835644/) to a pastor who was suing because CBP officers, believing she was tied to a caravan, requested that the Mexican government deny her entry.
