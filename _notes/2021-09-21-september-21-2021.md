Starting in mid-September 2021, and peaking around September 18-21, a large number of mostly Haitian migrants crossed the Rio Grande at Del Rio, Texas, a remote sector of the border across from Ciudad Acuña, Coahuila, Mexico. By September 18, Del Rio's mayor, citing information from Border Patrol, [said](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/19/haitian-migrants-del-rio-texas-border) that 14,534 migrants were encamped on the riverbank, under and around the border crossing bridge. There, while awaiting their turn to be processed by Border Patrol, they washed in the river and slept in tents, under shelters built out of vegetation, or in the open air.

In response to the Haitians' rapid arrival, CBP surged 600 Border Patrol agents, CBP officers, and DHS volunteers to Del Rio, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas [said](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/22/politics/border-patrol-resources-del-rio-june/index.html) during a September 20 visit to the sector.

By September 21, CBP had [constructed](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/22/politics/border-patrol-resources-del-rio-june/index.html) a field hospital and was more systematically providing food. But for the first several days, food and clean water were scarce at the Del Rio site. This forced migrants to wade into Ciudad Acuña, Mexico to buy food at local stores and restaurants, then wade back into the United States with their provisions.

On their return to U.S. soil, some of the migrants, often laden with bags of food, encountered hostile Border Patrol agents on horseback. Photos and videos showed agents appearing to charge at migrants, including some children, at the water's edge, apparently trying to force them to return to Mexico. One can be heard using a profane slur against Haiti. Some are shown waving or making slapping motions with lariats or long reins, which bore a resemblance to whips.

"Video footage of Border Patrol's actions in this incident clearly demonstrate that the migrants being encountered by mounted agents did not present an imminent threat," an ACLU [letter](https://www.aclutx.org/sites/default/files/aclu_tx_cbp_oig_letter_re_border_patrol_in_del_rio.pdf) describes the scene. "In one video an agent stops a family with small children, makes derogatory and xenophobic comments to the family, and then maneuvers his horse in a way that comes dangerously close to trampling a child."

Border Patrol Chief Raúl Ortiz, a former Del Rio sector chief, [claimed](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-09-22/haitian-migrants-del-rio-border-patrol-horseback) the agents were attempting to control the horses with the reins. The _Washington Post's_ Philip Bump [wrote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/20/what-one-photo-border-tells-us-about-evolving-migrant-crisis/) that "this was an apparently isolated encounter, one that soon resolved with those seeking to enter the country and return to or arrive at the camp able to do so."

Nonetheless, images of uniformed White men on horseback menacing Black people with what looked like whips blanketed U.S. social media on September 19 and 20, inspiring horrified reactions.

Immigrant rights and civil rights groups [joined](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/23/biden-confronts-trio-setbacks-with-black-immigrant-groups/) in condemnation. In Miami, 200 Haitian-Americans protesting outside the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) field office [forced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/haitian-migrants-racism/2021/09/22/e400793e-1be1-11ec-bcb8-0cb135811007_story.html) road closures. The NAACP [tweeted](https://twitter.com/NAACP/status/1440433080477519872) side-by-side "then" and "now" images: a drawing of a slaveholder whipping a Black man next to one of the Del Rio photos. A letter from civil rights groups said Biden's promises for a more humane immigration policy "are being shredded before our eyes." Human Rights Watch [called](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/09/21/us-treatment-haitian-migrants-discriminatory) it "the latest example of racially discriminatory, abusive, and illegal U.S. border policies that are returning people to harm and humanitarian disaster."

Reactions in Congress were strong. The images were "horrific and disturbing," [said](https://theintercept.com/2021/09/21/biden-haiti-texas-del-rio-asylum/) Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Mississippi), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. "We had not seen the horses and the whips with any other population of people, so that to us goes to racism," [said](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/us/politics/house-democrats-haitian-migrants.html) Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. House Oversight Committee Democrats sent a [letter](/files/2021-09-22_house.pdf) demanding a briefing from Biden administration officials by September 24 ([original link](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/read-the-letter-from-lawmakers-demanding-answers-on-treatment-of-haitian-migrants/9e164db6d5b98eed/full.pdf)).

Strong words also came from the Biden administration itself. "As it relates to those photos and that horrific video, we're not going to stand for that kind of inhumane treatment and obviously we want this investigation to be completed rapidly," [said](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/us/politics/house-democrats-haitian-migrants.html) White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki. "What I saw depicted, those individuals on horseback treating human beings the way they were, was horrible," [said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/21/haitian-migrants-texas-del-rio-bridge-expelled-us-mexico) Vice President Kamala Harris. "Human beings should never be treated that way, and I'm deeply troubled about it."

On September 24, President Joe Biden [addressed](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/24/biden-condemns-border-patrol-treatment-of-haitian-migrants-in-del-rio.html) the images for the first time. "It's horrible what you saw. To see people like they did, with horses, running them over, people being strapped, it's outrageous," he said. "I promise you, those people will pay. There is an investigation underway right now and there will be consequences."

DHS [promised](https://twitter.com/SecMayorkas/status/1440392456223092737) an investigation and [disciplinary](/files/2021-09-20_dhs_twt.pdf) actions, and suspended the use of horse patrols in Del Rio ([original link](https://twitter.com/DHSgov/status/1440090164425019397)). However, "There is little reason to have confidence in the department's willingness to hold its agents accountable," Chris Rickerd and Sarah Turberville [contend](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-09-22/haitian-migrants-del-rio-border-patrol-horseback) at the _Los Angeles Times_, noting that "CBP's own records found that it took no action in 96% of 1,255 cases of alleged Border Patrol misconduct between January 2012 and October 2015."

The DHS Inspector-General declined to take the case, and CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility [shared](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/border-agents-controversial-photos-horseback-questioned-source/story?id=80801383) preliminary findings with the Justice Department in October, to determine whether criminal charges were warranted. As of January 2022, other than a [list](/files/2021-11-16_dhs.pdf) of next steps that DHS published in mid-November, there had been no further word ([original link](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/11/16/dhs-update-regarding-investigation-horse-patrol-activity-del-rio-texas-september-19)). The _Washington Examiner_, citing unnamed DHS officials, [reported](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/report-on-texas-horse-patrol-incident-may-never-materialize) on January 27 that “a report may never be released.”
