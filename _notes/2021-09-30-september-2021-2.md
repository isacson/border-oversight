"Belone Mpembele, an asylum seeker from Angola, was expelled to Haiti by the United States due to its failure to provide access to the U.S asylum system or even screen individuals at the border in its rush to expel Haitians in September 2021," [reported](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/illegal-and-inhumane-biden-administration-continues-embrace-trump-title-42-policy-attacks) Human Rights First. The _Guardian_ [reported](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/sep/26/they-treated-us-like-animals-haitians-angry-and-in-despair-at-being-deported-from-us) from Port-au-Prince that the Angolan migrant "had never set foot in Haiti. 'I told them I am not Haitian,' said Belone Mpembele, as he emerged, dazed, from the terminal. 'But they didn’t listen.'”
