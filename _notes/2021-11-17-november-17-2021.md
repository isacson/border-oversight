Just before a mandate that all federal employees be vaccinated against COVID-19 by November 22, Border Patrol had a 79 percent [rate](https://myrgv.com/featured/2021/11/27/border-patrol-prepares-to-address-non-compliant-unvaccinated-agents/) of full vaccination. Another 16 percent of agents had pending requests for exemptions from the mandate, much higher than the federal government average, leaving 5 percent unvaccinated or unresponsive. At the _Intercept_, Ken Klippenstein [wrote](https://theintercept.com/2021/12/01/covid-vaccine-mandate-border-patrol/) about agents who resent or are resisting the vaccine mandate. In it, an agent in the Rio Grande Valley sector sent an e-mail to 3,000 colleagues that began, "You said, ‘STOP THE SPREAD!!’ but that should have been our battle cry, ‘STOP THE SPREAD OF ILLEGAL ALIENS INTO THE COUNTRY."
