Rodney Scott, the Trump administration’s last Border Patrol chief who exited his position in August, [faced](https://www.vice.com/en/article/epxx9n/trumps-border-patrol-chief-rape-threat-on-twitter) a San Diego Superior Court judge for a September tweet in which he advised former Border Patrol agent turned activist Jenn Budd, who has [recounted](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/border-baja-california/story/2021-02-14/jenn-budd-border-patrol-critic) being raped at the Border Patrol academy, to “lean back, close your eyes, and just enjoy the show.” Budd also [posted screenshots](https://twitter.com/BuddJenn/status/1466149122751094786) on Twitter showing Scott among those on private CBP and Border Patrol agents’ Facebook groups sharing [images](https://twitter.com/ALT_uscis/status/1466127766248726537) of Border Patrol shoulder patches reading “Let’s Go Brandon,” a right-wing euphemism for “F— Joe Biden.”
