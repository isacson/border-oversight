December 2021 [guidance](/files/2021-12-02_mpp_guidance.pdf) for implementation of the “Remain in Mexico” (RMX) program specified that individuals should be exempted from the program if they suffer from mental or physical health issues or disabilities; vulnerabilities from advanced age; or risk of harm due to sexual orientation or gender identity ([original link](https://www.dhs.gov/publication/court-ordered-reimplementation-mpp-policy-guidance)). Nonetheless, a January 2022 Human Rights First [report](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/ShamefulRecord.pdf) found that CBP officers, even during the initial days of RMX, were not performing required health screenings.

> CBP officers are also failing to ask health screening questions and falsely recording on the “Initial Health Interview Questionnaire” that migrants and asylum seekers placed in RMX have reported that they do not have any serious medical conditions. None of the 18 individuals in RMX who Human Rights First interviewed in Ciudad Juárez in December 2021 had been asked the 11 health screening questions on the form. Some were not asked any health-related questions, while others said that CBP officers inquired only generally about health issues.
