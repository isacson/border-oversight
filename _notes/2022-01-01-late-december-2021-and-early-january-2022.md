A January 2022 Human Rights First [report](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/ShamefulRecord.pdf) discussed examples of CBP personnel hindering access to counsel for migrants placed into the “Remain in Mexico” (RMX) program, even though the Biden administration’s December 2021 [guidance](/files/2021-12-02_mpp_guidance.pdf) guarantees that those who fear return to Mexico may have the opportunity to consult with an attorney before their _non-refoulement_ interviews with U.S. asylum officers ([original link](https://www.dhs.gov/publication/court-ordered-reimplementation-mpp-policy-guidance)).

> A Nicaraguan asylum seeker reported to Human Rights First that CBP officers threatened that his _non-refoulment_ interview would be rescheduled and his detention in horrible CBP custody extended, if he insisted on speaking to an attorney, thereby pressuring him to go ahead without an attorney. In another case, CBP officers tricked an individual who is unable to read into signing a document waiving his opportunity to have counsel during the RMX fear screening interview. CBP officers told him that by signing the document he would be indicating that he had a fear of returning to Mexico, according to attorneys from the Border Project.

> Multiple asylum seekers who did not pass RMX fear screening interviews and were returned to Ciudad Juárez in December 2021 reported that CBP officers falsely told them that they would have to pay for an attorney consultation for the RMX fear screening even though the Border Project was providing free legal consultations at the time. As a result, the individuals went ahead with their _non-refoulement_ interviews without legal counsel.

> In early December 2021, RMX returnees interviewed by Human Rights First in Ciudad Juárez said that they were not provided informational flyers explaining access to legal services until after the _non-refoulement_ interview was completed or, in some cases, as they were being returned to Mexico by CBP. Several individuals returned to Tijuana under RMX in early January 2022 also reported that they were not informed that they could consult with a lawyer until after the _non-refoulement_ interview was already completed, according to a volunteer with the California Welcoming Task Force.

> CBP officers told a Nicaraguan asylum seeker detained in El Paso he could only speak with a lawyer selected for him by DHS, which he would have to pay for. The man told Human Rights First that his request to contact his family to ask them to hire a lawyer was denied by CBP. As a result, he was unable to speak with a lawyer before CBP returned him to Ciudad Juárez under RMX.

As RMX relaunched in San Diego in January 2022, asylum seekers and migrants there "told a volunteer from the California Welcoming Task Force that they were not informed of the opportunity to contact counsel prior to the _non-refoulement_ interview and were told by CBP officers that they would be returned to Mexico regardless of the outcome of that interview."
