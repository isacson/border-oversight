A Border Patrol agent surreptitiously recorded audio of a discussion between DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and agents assembled in Yuma, Arizona. The agent [leaked](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/juliorosas/2022/01/26/audio-recording-of-dhs-sec-mayorkas-disastrous-tense-with-yuma-border-patrol-agen-n2602386) the audio to TownHall.com, a right-wing website. It recorded agents complaining about policies that allow asylum-seeking migrants to remain in the United States while their cases are adjudicated. One agent turned his back while the Secretary spoke to him.

On January 28, agents [leaked](https://www.facebook.com/AliBradleyTV/videos/512111106860585/?extid=NS-UNK-UNK-UNK-IOS_GK0T-GK1C) video of a tense exchange between Border Patrol Chief Raúl Ortiz and agents during Mayorkas's visit to Laredo, Texas. An agent says, "For evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing… You’re allowing illegal aliens to be dropped off in communities." CNN [reported](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/politics/border-patrol-agents-mayorkas/index.html) that an agent in Laredo confronted Mayorkas for wearing a jacket with the Border Patrol badge.

Border Patrol management [circulated](https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/1487180450275770369) a 2010 memo reminding agents that surreptitious recording of coworkers “falls below the standards of integrity.”
